        An inflection point is defined as the moment on a graph in which
        significant change occurs. It is a tipping point, before the line
        changes in direction, flexing and curving towards an unknown
        destination.
      </p>
      <p>
        We currently stand at a point of inflection, as we have many times
        before. Throughout our lives, we have reached many milestones—from the
        moment we took our first steps, to our first days at RISD, we have
        continuously changed and evolved. And with us, the world has changed
        too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our lives have recently been marked by major political and social shifts
        on a global scale, which have pushed us to respond with agility and
        endurance to these changing times both within our personal affairs as
        well as our design practices. As graphic designers, we cannot ignore
        them—from the social movements of Black Lives Matter and pursuits of
        racial justice, equity, and equality, to the impact of COVID-19 on our
        education and relationships—the world we live in informs who we are and
        what we do.
      </p>
      <p>
        At our present moment, we, the RISD GD Class of 2021, sit at this
        tipping point between the end of our education and the beginning of our
        careers; a known and unknown, a collective past reflected against a
        divergent future. As we gather both physically and digitally, Point of
        Inflection sets out to not only serve as a document to our work, with
        its various points of perspectives and approaches, but to also function
        as a point of reflection. Through this show, we celebrate our growth and
        shifts that mark the time spent both in and out of the department, in
        hopes to map the spaces between, to honor the people we’ve met, the
        connections we’ve made, and the things that we’ve learned.
